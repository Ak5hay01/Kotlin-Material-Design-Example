# Material-Design-Example

I have implemented a small example of material design in Android. Material design is very handy and easy to use, if you want to do the validation. I have tried to implement example with "TextInputLayout" but there are also other components in material design. You can add custom icons or inbuilt icons, add click events for the icons and so on

Here every Text Input layout represent the different properties that can be used for better UI and validations like Password, word count, required validation and so on
